Once upon a midnight dreary as I pondered weak and weary

Ah distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor
Eagerly I wished the morrow--vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore
From that rare and radient maiden whom the angels named Lenore
